## Introduction

Hello, my name is Islam Zaoui and I am a Computer Science student at the University of M'sila in Algeria. I built this website using Sveltekit, the Skeleton UI library, and several other amazing libraries that were provided by the Svelte and JS community. 

## My Goals

I am passionate about programming and want to share my knowledge and experiences with others. To that end, I will be creating tutorials on various programming topics that I have learned and will also be documenting various tips and tricks that can help people.

## What I Will Achieve From This

I hope to provide ongoing support to those who are interested in programming and help them to achieve their goals.
