# Introduction to Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a crucial software component that manages hardware and software resources on a computer. It acts as an intermediary between applications and the computer's hardware, enabling users to interact with the system and execute tasks efficiently. This markdown provides a brief overview of operating systems and includes a code snippet showcasing how to list files in a directory using Python.

## Types of Operating Systems

Operating systems can be classified into several categories based on their design and purpose:

1. **Single-User Single-Task OS:** Supports one user and runs one application at a time (e.g., MS-DOS).
2. **Single-User Multi-Task OS:** Supports one user and can run multiple applications concurrently (e.g., Windows, macOS).
3. **Multi-User OS:** Allows multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously (e.g., Linux, Unix).
4. **Real-Time OS:** Designed for time-sensitive applications and provides deterministic response times (e.g., VxWorks).
5. **Embedded OS:** Optimized for specific devices or embedded systems (e.g., FreeRTOS).

## Code Snippet: Listing Files in a Directory using Python

Python provides a straightforward way to list files in a directory using the `os` module. The following code snippet demonstrates how to achieve this:

<CodeBlock language="python" lineNumbers code={code}></CodeBlock>

Make sure to replace `"/path/to/your/directory"` with the actual path of the directory you want to list. The `os.listdir()` function retrieves a list of all items in the given directory. We then filter out the files using `os.path.isfile()` and print the names of the files.

Remember that operating systems provide various functionalities, and Python's `os` module is just one way to interact with them. Each OS has its own set of system calls and APIs to access and manage resources effectively.
